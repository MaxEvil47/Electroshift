# Electroshift
Electroshift Website

This is a website I made as Homework, I'll probably update it with stuff I learn on the way, but the site is finished, so I'll let it be.
Please don't modify this, as I'm proud of my work here.
If you're new on WebDev and/or you're looking to learn something, you're of course free to look the code!
